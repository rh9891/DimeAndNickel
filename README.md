## Description

Dime and Nickel is a mobile-responsive, budget tracking application. (It is the MERN-stack version of [Dime and Penny](https://github.com/rh9891/DimeAndPenny). The application takes the original dynamically updated vanilla javascript project and updates it to a React application while adding a backend API with Express and MongoDB.)

## User Story

```
AS A user
I WANT to track items I purchase (and their cost) and calculate the amount of money spent over time
SO THAT I can manage my daily spending efficiently.
```

## Features of the Application

```
GIVEN an expense-tracking application
WHEN I want to add an income
THEN I insert a positive amount with a description of the transaction and add the transaction.

WHEN I want to track an expense
THEN I insert a negative amount with a description of the transaction and add the transaction.

WHEN I add an expense
THEN the transaction is displayed under "Recent Transactions" and marked in red.

WHEN I add an income
THEN the transaction is displayed under "Recent Transactions" and marked in green.

WHEN I hover over a listed transaction
THEN an X will be displayed that can be clicked to delete the transaction.
```
